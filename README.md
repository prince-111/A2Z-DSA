### Additional Tips for a DSA-Focused README:
1. **Be Clear on Complexity**: For each problem, clearly mention the time and space complexity of your solution.
2. **Explain Your Approach**: DSA problems can often be solved in multiple ways. Explaining why you chose a particular approach (e.g., recursion vs iteration, dynamic programming vs brute force) is valuable.
3. **Optimization**: If applicable, explain any optimizations you implemented, like reducing space complexity or improving time complexity from brute-force methods.
4. **Challenges Faced**: Mention any difficulties you encountered while solving the problems and how you overcame them.
5. **Test Cases**: Include information on the test cases used to verify the correctness of your solutions.

This structure ensures your DSA solutions are well-documented and easy to navigate for others (or yourself in the future).



# DSA Problem Solutions

## Description
This repository contains solutions to a variety of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. Each solution includes a step-by-step approach, explanation of the algorithm used, and optimized code. The problems cover topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
